        <h2>What motivates me</h2>
        <p>What motivates me the most is the love of technology, and wanting to learn new skills everyday.</br>
           Technology is something that facinates me and makes me question on how can I make the world a better place.

        <p>I heard about PLP Academy from a family member.
            Who was doing a software enginering course.
        </p>

        <h2>What was it like in begging of the course?</h2>

        <p>In the begging I was very nervouse, because dont have a background on software engineering. <br/>
            As I went through my journy with PLP Academy saw the it was not that hard.I love how the lucters explained the content.<br/>
            Now I understand the content very easyly.
        </p>

        <h2>Which content did you find fasinating?</h2>
         <p>found python and Github facinating.</p>
