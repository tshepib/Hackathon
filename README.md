*Note: This README assumes the repository contains HTML files and possibly a `style.css`. The linked certificate file path (`Certificate_of_Completion.html.pdf`) should be adjusted to match the actual file path in the repository. The PDF file itself should be included in the repository for the link to work. This README also omits the actual CSS styling details, which should be mentioned if they are unique or significant.*

*Remember to save this file as `README.md` in the root directory of your GitHub repository for it to display correctly.*
